Computing Tax Program: 

The United States federal personal income tax is calculated based on filing status and taxable income. 

There are four filing statuses: single filers, married filing jointly, married filing separately, and head of household. 

The tax rates vary every year. The table below shows the rates for 2009. 

A Single Person with a taxable income of $10,000, the first $8,350 is taxed at 10% and the other $1,650 is taxed at 15%. So, your tax is $1,082.5.

Program computes personal income tax. 

The Program should prompt the user to enter the filing status and taxable income and compute the tax. 
Enter 0 for single filers, 1 for married filing jointly, 2 for married filing separately, and 3 for head of household. 

Here are sample runs:

```
Enter the filing status: 0
Enter the taxable income: 100000
Tax is 21720.0
```

```
Enter the filing status: 1
Enter the taxable income: 300339
Tax is 76932.87
```

```
Enter the filing status: 2
Enter the taxable income: 123500
Tax is 29665.5
```

```
Enter the filing status: 3
Enter the taxable income: 4545402
Tax is 1565250.7
```

PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Write a program that computes the personal income tax. 
The program must prompt the user to enter filing status and taxable income along with tax computation. 
Single Filers = 0
Married: File Jointly = 1 
Married: File Separately = 2 
Head of Household = 3
